# CVE-2026-26996: minimatch ReDoS vulnerability
# Tracked in: https://thetradedesk.atlassian.net/browse/UID2-6617
#
# Suppressed for minimatch 3.1.2 and 5.1.6 which are pulled in ONLY by
# devDependencies (eslint, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y,
# eslint-plugin-react, jest/test-exclude, jake/filelist). These versions
# are not reachable at runtime in the production application.
#
# The production dependency (nodemon) is pinned to minimatch ^10.2.1
# via a Yarn selective resolution, which resolves to 10.2.2 (fixed).
#
# Yarn v1's flat node_modules model cannot install two different versions
# of minimatch simultaneously without breaking eslint-plugin-import, which
# calls minimatch() as a default-export function (pre-v6 API). Upgrading
# eslint-plugin-import to a version supporting minimatch v10 requires
# migrating to ESLint v9, which is a separate effort.
#
# Expires: 2027-02-20 — revisit when eslint-plugin-import or ESLint is upgraded.
