      <h1>UID2 ADMINISTRATOR PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

      <i class="updated padded">Effective Date: April 1, 2025</i>
      
      <p class="bold">Introduction – About the UID2</p>
      <br />
        
      <p>
        The Trade Desk developed the UNIFIED ID 2.0 (“UID2”) service to provide advertisers, publishers, 
        and other organizations in the advertising ecosystem a standardized and technical means to transform email addresses and phone numbers into unique identifiers called UID2s. 
        The UID2 is created by putting an email address or phone number through a series of algorithms to turn it into a string of text and numbers so that it is no longer recognizable as that email address or phone number. 
        Like many other types of identifiers that do not directly reveal your real-life identity, such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, and device identifiers, 
        UID2 identifiers enable companies to gather and combine data across different sites, apps, and other contexts, to share data with each other to facilitate the buying and selling of advertising online, 
        including Targeted Advertising (as defined by applicable laws), and to measure the results of advertising online. This helps advertisers to show ads that are more relevant to you, 
        limits the number of times you see the same ad, and enables publishers to earn more for the same ad, helping fund their online content.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>The parties that make up the UID2 ecosystem include participants, operators, and an administrator.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The companies that use the UID2 service are called “participants.” Examples of participants include retailers that want to reach customers with ads for shoes or sweaters, 
          news sites that make money from publishing ads, and advertising technology companies that use data to help advertisers and publishers show better-personalized ads. 
          The Trade Desk acts as a participant in the UID2 service in its capacity as a “demand side platform” or "Platform,” which helps advertisers and their agencies to manage advertising campaigns across many channels. 
          You can read about our privacy practices for our Platform, including as a participant in the UID2 service, in our Platform Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participants work with an "operator,” which transforms email addresses and phone numbers provided by participants to create UID2 identifiers on behalf of such participants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, an “administrator” oversees access to the technology used to generate and maintain UID2 identifiers and hosts the UID2 Transparency and Control Portal where you can express an opt-out choice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="bold">The Trade Desk currently acts as the administrator of the UID2 service, and this UID2 Privacy Policy explains The Trade Desk’s practices concerning data, 
        including personal data or personal information (“personal data”), only in its role as UID2 administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy does not cover the practices of the other participants that use the UID2 service. More information on participants’ privacy practices is set out in their respective privacy policies.
      </p>


      <h2>
        UID2 TRANSPARENCY AND CONTROL PORTAL
      </h2>
      <p>
        A core role of the UID2 administrator, which is currently The Trade Desk, is to offer the UID2 Transparency and Control Portal to take in opt-out requests related to UID2s. 
        You can use the <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.com/" target="_blank">Transparency and Control Portal</a> to submit an opt-out request to the administrator. 
        We then make your choice to opt-out of the use of UID2 for targeted advertising purposes available to participants so they can honor your choice.
      </p>


      <h2>COLLECTION OF DATA BY UID2 ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
      <p>
        In connection with hosting the Transparency and Control Portal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We collect <b>email addresses</b> and <b>phone numbers</b> users input in the portal to indicate their choice to opt out of targeted advertising based on their 
          UID2 and we hash those email addresses and phone numbers and transform them into the corresponding UID2 to process the opt-out request;
        </li>
        <li>
          We automatically collect <b>technical information</b> about your visit to the portal, including your IP address, browser, platform type, and device type; and
        </li>
        <li>
          As the UID2 administrator, we may also receive some of this same information from or on behalf of participants.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regardless of how we receive this information, we use it for the limited purposes described in the “Use of Data by UID2 Administrator” section immediately below.
      </p>


      <h2>
        USE OF DATA BY UID2 ADMINISTRATOR
      </h2>
      <p>
        As the UID2 administrator, we mainly use the data listed above to process and maintain a record of your opt-out request, including by making your choice to opt-out of the use of UID2 for 
        targeted advertising purposes available to participants so they can honor your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use the information we receive as UID2 administrator:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To provide and administer the Transparency and Control Portal;
        </li>
        <li>
          To engage in troubleshooting;
        </li>
        <li>
          To help detect and protect against fraud;
        </li>
        <li>
          For security purposes; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Internally, to improve how the UID2 service functions.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For example, if many participants transmit requests to the administrator using an API, we may review how the requests are configured to enable us to process the requests more efficiently.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h2>
        DISCLOSURE OF DATA BY UID2 ADMINISTRATOR
      </h2>
      <p>
        We disclose the information we receive as UID2 administrator in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We provide information about your opt-out choice (including, in some cases the UID2 and the opt-out signal) to participants in the UID2 service so they can honor your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also disclose the information we collect as UID2 administrator in response to lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet security or law enforcement requirements, 
          and where necessary to protect our own or others’ rights, property, or safety, including for security and fraud detection and prevention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, we may disclose information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, transitioning the service to a new administrator (such as an industry organization) or in connection
          with a corporate restructuring, merger, sale of assets, financing, or similar transaction involving The Trade Desk.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also make information available among The Trade Desk and our current and future parents, affiliates, 
          and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership for the purposes described in the “Use of Data by UID2 Administrator” section above.
        </li>
      </ul>

        ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR RESIDENTS OF SPECIFIC STATES

        The Trade Desk does not knowingly collect or process sensitive personal data in connection with our role as the administrator of the UID2 service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our role as administrator of the UID2 service, we store personal data for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes
